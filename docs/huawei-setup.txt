Just to test things out, do the following:
sudo modprobe  ftdi_sio vendor=0x12d1 product=0x1003

You can then connect on /dev/ttyUSB0

Minicom requires you to disable hardware handshaking (ctrl-A then O)

Note the vendor and product details come from lsmod.

The device is a Huawei E270 but reports itself as a E220 and an E230 as well

For permanent setup, add the following line to the /etc/modules file:

ftdi_sio vendor=0x12d1 product=0x1003

Setup commands for the modem:

at^curc=1     // Enable unsolicited response codes
at^portsel=1  // Allow unsolicited messages to get to serial port 
at+clip=1     // Enable caller line identification for incoming calls

If the device receives a phone call, you get output like this:

+CLIP: "+27xxxxxxxx6",145,,,,0

at+chup       // Hangup a call
